# Components Directory

This directory is intended for reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application. Each component should be self-contained and may include its own styles and tests.

## Guidelines

- Each component should have its own directory within this folder.
- Use descriptive names for components to reflect their purpose.
- Include a README.md file in each component's directory if additional documentation is necessary.
- Ensure components are reusable and maintainable.
- Follow the project's styling guidelines for consistency.
